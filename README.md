# -The-Escape-Room-puzzle

Problem Statement: You are trapped in a room with two doors. One door leads to certain death, while the other door leads to freedom. Two guards stand in front of the doorsâ€”one guard always tells the truth, and the other always lies. You can ask one guard one question to determine which door leads to freedom. What question should you ask?


Solution: To find the door to freedom, ask either guard the following question: "If I were to ask the other guard which door leads to freedom, what would they say?" Then choose the opposite door of the one the guard indicates. Since the truthful guard will truthfully state the lie the lying guard would tell, and the lying guard will lie about what the truthful guard would say, you will get the correct answer.
